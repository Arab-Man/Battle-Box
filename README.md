### Battle-Box
This is a scrapped project that I developed when I was in high school (Year 8-9).

## About this game
This game is a free-for-all fighting game, where players are placed randomly across the map and have to duel it out, last player standing wins. Players will have the opportunity to get money by playing and can use their cash to buy new weapons and upgrade their style.

## Why did I abandon this project
I made the game on Roblox's game engine, which frankly was not a good choice. I'm basically only limited to the roblox character models and assets and it was kinda janky.

The game is written in Lua 2.0, and I had to abandon the project because the game kinda broke after a random update that ruined how music and sound worked in the game (this pissed me off so much because I had really good music picked for each map)

The Roblox studio workspace is also weird to interact with, although it makes it so much easier to change element properties, writing scripts is what I struggled with, and my young feeble brain couldn't handle that much work.


This was just one reason why I stopped, high school was also stressful at the time so I had no time to work on this. This project meant a lot to me, and is probably why I went into computer science.


## What's next

I will most likely not work on this project further, even though I put a lot of effort into it at the time, its not worth my time to continue working on it, considering its on Roblox.

The maps and the code structure will stay here, in case I decide to make another game in the future, albeit on a different game engine with more freedom to do whatever I want.

I finally decided to put my game here instead of keeping it on Roblox Studio, because I want to be reminded of my efforts, and to showcase what I can do.
